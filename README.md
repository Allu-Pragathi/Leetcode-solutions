# 💻 LeetCode Solutions — Auto-Synced & Curated
Welcome to my personal vault of LeetCode solutions — not just a collection of code, but a reflection of my journey through algorithms, data structures, problem-solving, and late-night debugging marathons.

This repository is automatically synced using a custom script that fetches every accepted solution directly from my LeetCode profile. No manual uploads, no outdated files — just a clean, consistent, and version-controlled archive of progress.

# 🧠 What’s Inside?
✅ All accepted solutions across multiple languages (mostly Python, Java, and SQL)
📊 Problems organized by topic, difficulty, and tags
🛠️ Dynamic updates without the need for git add or git commit
📁 File names match the actual problem titles for easy searching

# 🚀 Why This Repo?
I wanted more than just solving problems — I wanted to track my growth, share learnings, and maybe even help others. This repo is part dev diary, part public record, and part digital garden of algorithms I’ve tamed.

Whether you're a fellow LeetCoder, a recruiter browsing my work, or someone just starting out — feel free to explore, fork, or star 🌟 this repo. Who knows, you might find that one problem you’ve been stuck on.

“Consistency is what transforms average into excellence.” — This repo is my attempt at exactly that.
